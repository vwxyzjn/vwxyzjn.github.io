    <h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹, </h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my personal website. 
      My name is Costa Huang and I am a Computer Science Ph.D student @ Drexel University, in collaboration with my advisor
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/santiagoontanonvillar/">Santiago OntaÃ±Ã³n</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like doing research a lot and my primary research direction is to use RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithms to train agents in RTS (Real-time Strategy Games).
      My recent work include a RL library (<a href="https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl">CleanRL</a>) for hackable and carefully managed
      experimentation and an OpenAI Gym wrapper (<a href="https://github.com/vwxyzjn/gym-microrts">Gym-MicroRTS</a> ) 
      for training agents in a minimalistic RTS game called <a href="https://github.com/santiontanon/microrts">MicroRTS</a>. Feel free to 
      go to the <a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a> section to see my recent projects ðŸ˜†.
    </p>
    <p>
      My most skilled languages are Python, Go, and JavaScript/Node.js.
      I use Python for general programming tasks such as Machine Learning, 
      Data Analysis, Mathematics, Web Crawler. Recently, I have been using Pytorch
      quite frequently for all of my projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I use Go for backend API development, and JavaScript/Node.js for
      web programming by using frameworks such as Vue.js, React.js, Vuetify.js, and etc. I also frequently use Latex to type Math and CS homeworks. You may find some samples of my work here:
